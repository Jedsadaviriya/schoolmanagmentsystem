I also created a custom logo for this application. It was designed to match the tone of the app and give it a clear visual identity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Setup

**Built With:**
- React (with JSX)
- Next.js
- JavaScript
- CSS (custom, no Tailwind)
- MongoDB (via a simple backend connection)

**Run Locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms.git
cd sms
npm install
# Create a .env.local file
# Add your MongoDB URI:
# MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
npm run dev
```
## üìò Project Context

This app was built during a 3-day project week at GIB, where teams had to create a complete application within a tight time frame. We were a group of three, and the goal was not only technical execution but also collaboration, presentation, and documentation.

In those three days, we built a fully working school tool with persistent data storage, multiple features, and a polished UI.
